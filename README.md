#[Facial Detection Application](https://bartholomewbd.github.io/imgdetection/)
This product is a demo MVP and has very minumum security and very limited validation(It can and will break) 

Detects a face in an image.  (I have plans to add functionality to identify images with no faces and multiple faces possible add the option to put images over faces)

I learned a lot about React including but not limited to Components, props, lifecycle and state.  I also implemented a express server an API and a PostgreSQL database for it.

The Server & Database are being hosted on [Heroku](https://aqueous-meadow-49375.herokuapp.com/) and source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Bartholomewbd/Facial-Detection-Backend)
